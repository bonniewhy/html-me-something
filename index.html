                    -- Talk about how my mom loved to play video games and I would watch her play Super Mario Bros and help by telling her what enemy was coming up cause I knew by the sound.
                    -- Origin of pixel art love.
                    -- Adventures in LoLo in Eugene. One of the first video games I personally ever played by myself.
                    -- Sega Channel -- Still searching for that awesome Russian themed brick breaker game that probably never actually got published
                    -- Tekken 2 and sneaking playing Mortal Combat at my cousins (probably their neighbors house, don't quite remember) because of the visible blood. And we always put it on extra blood (look up the actual name for this, it's been so long)
                    -- Learned HTML because of the video game Babyz and Homestead.com being so horribly limiting.

                <p>
                    -- Super Smash Bros at Sean's house. I'd always kick ass as Peach, but only cause I'd hide away from the fray and let the better players kill each other off before going head to head with the last man standing.
                    -- Silent Hill and getting over my "fear" of the horror genre in movies and other things. (Insert picture of your Silent Hill nurse costume here...)
                    -- DDR! First "heavy song" Abyss. Spending all my free time at Park Lanes because I finally had friends thanks to video games. Was hooked from the first moment I played (First song Ordinary World). My first boyfriend's Stepmania and hard DDR pad in his basement. Spent all my savings from my horrible job DEB on 75cent joint premium. DDR prom. 
                    -- Soul Calibur II when i wasn't my turn to play. First time I really saw my name on the leader board. 4th place on conquest mode with Taki.
                    -- Then XBOX came out and my friends got super into Halo. And I couldn't work the damned xbox controllers two way moving... so I stopped playing video games.

                <h1>adulthood</h1>
                <p>
                    -- I had convinced myself that I was terrible at them. And shouldn't waste my time.
                    -- Switched to forum based text RPGs
                    -- Once my friends "grew up" and grew on from high school age, my interest also waned.
                    -- Until one day I was browsing my forums and someone had a picture of a creeper from Minecraft as their signature. Then I discovered Let's Plays on YouTube and minecraft. Started playing in Beta before you had to pay. I was hooked and would play on the computer at Linda Hall Library while I was at work waiting for the phone to ring.

                <h1>today</h1>
                <p>
                    -- Eventually, watching Let's Plays, I saw someone playing "Papers, Please" and thus began my journey into buying way too many games during the Steam sales.
                    -- Been obsessed with Steam and all of their awesome indie games
                    -- My favorite Steam genres are "Great Soundtrack" "Pixel Graphics" "Atmospheric" "" ""
                    -- Recently discovered Humble Bundle when my friend gave me a couple of games she already had bought on Steam that she recieved from the Bundle. It's cool cause it donates to charity and you get some games you have never heard of / probably wouldn't have been interested in before. And it's only 12$ a month. (Don't know if I really wanna add a Humble Bundle ad, haha.) #notspons
                    -- Minecraft was how I finally broke the ice with my shy, but awesome nephew Lucas. He finally thought I was cool when I told him I loved playing Minecraft. And now we play every other week together when I go to visit my parents. His favorite mob is the piggy.
                    -- Lucas and my other nephew Daniel got me, my mom, my dad, and my sister all into this Roblox game called Bee Swarm Simulator, and it's my current obsession. I usually have it on collecting pollen, while I study my chapters. I wonder what my next game obsession will be.
                    -- I've found I keep getting better and better at game as I get used to the way they work which of course means I have so much more fun. Winning is fun.

                <p>
                    -- Can only imagine that I'll get even better at games as I branch out into different genres.
                    -- Possibly could turn it into a career if people like me enough on Twitch / YouTube
                    -- Or could make it into an even better career if I could code my own games. I already have a bunch of really good (at least to me) ideas for games I want to make
                    -- At least 25% of why I wanted to come to LaunchCode.
