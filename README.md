# HTML ME SOMETHING
This is an assignment for LaunchCode 101. The first HTML one, as a matter of fact. I went a little crazy with graphics because I really enjoy making them. I'm kind of happy with it, though I still feel like I could work on it. While I already know HTML and CSS pretty well, this project was still such a good brush up on the markup language I haven't used in many years. I also really learned how to use GitHub and repositories a lot better as I worked on it with my two home computers. I still don't know why some of the errors / things that didn't work, didn't work as of yet, but I feel so much more comfortable with it, which is awesome. Can't wait for the next project.
